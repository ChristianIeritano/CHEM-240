# CHEM-240
 Python scripts for demonstrating key concepts used in the physical sciences

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the scripts, you need to install Python and set up some libraries. Follow these steps:

### Install Python

1. Download Python 3.12 from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, ensure you check the option `Add Python 3.12 to PATH` to make Python accessible from the command line.

### Install Required Libraries

Open your command line interface by typing `cmd` in the searchbar (windows users) or by typing `Terminal` in Spotlight Search (press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight; Mac users) and install the necessary Python libraries by typing:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
### Downlaod scripts

    1. Go to the GitHub repository containing the scripts.
    2. Navigate to the Module1_PythonSupplements folder.
    3. Download the desired scripts by clicking on each file and then clicking Download raw file (downwards arrow in the header of the code).
    4. Save the file to some where accesible on your main wokring drive (like a Desktop folder), then run the code by either double clicking it or via the command line (note that path\to\your\scripts must be updated to the path where the .py file is, and script_name.py must be the name of the python script):

```bash
cd path\to\your\scripts
python script_name.py
```
